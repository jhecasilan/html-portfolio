    <h1>My All Time Favorite Movies</h1>
    <h2>The Top 3 Movies according to me</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Black Hawk Down</h3>
    <p>The movie perfectly builds up the tension from the very beginning and when things finally happen, they never stopped. <br> 
        It's quite a long movie but I didn't get bored. I could watch all over again.</p>
    <h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
    <p>This movie by Wes Anderson has gripped my attention ever since the movie started. <br> 
        It has a nice blend of quirkiness and thrilling scenes that are typical of the director's style. <br>
        It's always fun to see the same set of favorite actors that are always present of Anderson's movies</p>
    <h3>Pirates</h3>
    <p>This little piece of korean cinema had me rolling with laughter. I didn't expect to like this kind of silly slapstick comedy but It really had me cracking <br>
    I just hope the sequel was as funny as the first one.</p>
